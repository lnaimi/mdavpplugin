# Introduction
MDE tool is a Visual Paradigm plugin designed to support users in implementing our Model Driven Engineering approach. It consists of three key components: architecture specification, PIM parameterization, and code generation.

Currently, the tool does not support model transformation composition, it is limited to model-to-text (M2T) transformations.

# Test
To test the plugin within Visual Paradigm, proceed as follows:

1. Download and install Visual Paradigm.
2. Copy the "Code Generation" folder from the "MDEPlugin" directory and paste it into the "plugins" folder of Visual Paradigm. For instance, the path looks like:
"C:/Users/<user_name>/AppData/Roaming/VisualParadigm/plugins".
3. Reload Visual Paradigm.

For further details on how to use the tool, please consult the "User Guide" document in the documentation.
